# Weather API — Simple Browser Client

A tiny client-side weather lookup app that fetches current conditions from WeatherAPI and displays the city name, local time, and temperature.

This repository contains a minimal static web app (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It's intended as a toy/demo app and includes notes on running locally and securing API keys.

## Files

- `index.html` — the UI markup with an input and a button.
- `style.css` — basic styles for the page.
- `app.js` — JavaScript that calls the WeatherAPI and updates the DOM.
- `README.md` — this file.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Optional: a simple static server for correct fetch behavior (recommended).
